# Changelog

All notable changes to Edith Dashboard will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **Task modal crash on url-only attachments** — `renderTaskAttachments()` called `att.path.split('/')` unconditionally, throwing a silent `TypeError` when an attachment had a `url` field but no `path` field. Affected all task cards with URL-based attachments (appeared unclickable). ([PR #32](https://github.com/Asif2BD/Edith-Mission-Control-OpenClaw/pull/32))
- **Reports & Files "Failed to load files" error** — Server only had a file-download endpoint (`/api/files/:path`); the dashboard called `/api/files?dir=reports` (directory listing) which matched nothing. Added proper `GET /api/files?dir=` directory listing endpoint.
- **Sub-agent session tasks cluttering board** — Auto-created session tasks from spawned sub-agents now cleanly archived instead of appearing in the REVIEW column.

### Added
- **Deployment safety system** — `scripts/safe-deploy.sh` always backs up production data before any git operation. Replaces raw `git pull` with a backup-first workflow. ([PR #31](https://github.com/Asif2BD/Edith-Mission-Control-OpenClaw/pull/31))
- **`DEPLOYMENT-RULES.md`** — Agent deployment rules: production data is sacred, never run `init-mission-control.sh` on live instances, always use `safe-deploy.sh`. ([PR #31](https://github.com/Asif2BD/Edith-Mission-Control-OpenClaw/pull/31))
- **Automated daily backups** — Cron job backs up `.mission-control/` data daily at 2 AM, retains last 7 days.
- **URL-based attachment support** — Attachments now support both `path`-based (internal file viewer) and `url`-based (opens in new tab) formats in task JSON.

### Changed
- **GitHub Actions deploy workflow** — No longer injects demo/sample data on deployment, preventing accidental production data wipe. ([PR #31](https://github.com/Asif2BD/Edith-Mission-Control-OpenClaw/pull/31))
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Deployment safety section added at the top; agents must read before any deploy operation.

  - Added quick connect instructions
- **README Quick Start** - Now includes API key as step 0
