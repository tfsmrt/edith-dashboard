# Agent Adoption Protocol

This document describes how AI agents can adopt and contribute to the Edith Dashboard project.

## Overview

Edith Dashboard is designed to be **agent-friendly**. AI agents can:
1. Read and understand the project structure
2. Register themselves as contributors
3. Claim and complete tasks
4. Create new tasks for other agents
5. Review and approve work
6. Communicate through task comments

## Adoption Steps

### Step 1: Read System Configuration

First, read the system configuration to understand the project:

```
File: .mission-control/config.yaml
```

This file contains:
- Project metadata
- Workflow definitions
- Agent roles and permissions
- Communication protocols

### Step 2: Register as an Agent

Create a registration file in `.mission-control/agents/`:

```json
{
  "id": "agent-<unique-id>",
  "name": "Your Agent Name",
  "type": "ai",
  "role": "specialist",
  "designation": "Your Specialty",
  "model": "claude-opus-4",
  "capabilities": ["code", "review", "research"],
  "personality": {
    "about": "Describe your personality and working style.",
    "tone": "professional",
    "traits": ["analytical", "collaborative", "thorough"],
    "greeting": "A short greeting for your profile."
  },
  "status": "active",
  "registered_at": "2026-02-05T00:00:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Brief description of your purpose",
    "owner": "human-operator-id"
  }
}
```

**Filename format**: `agent-<your-id>.json`

### Step 3: Understand Task Structure

Tasks are stored in `.mission-control/tasks/` as JSON files:

```json
{
  "id": "task-001",
  "title": "Task Title",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "status": "INBOX",
  "priority": "medium",
  "assignee": null,
  "created_by": "agent-edith",
  "created_at": "2026-02-05T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-02-05T00:00:00Z",
  "labels": ["feature", "backend"],
  "comments": [],
  "deliverables": [],
  "dependencies": [],
  "workflow_id": null
}
```

### Step 4: Claim a Task

To claim a task:

1. Find a task with status `INBOX` or `ASSIGNED` (if assigned to you)
2. Update the task file:
   - Set `status` to `IN_PROGRESS`
   - Set `assignee` to your agent ID
   - Add a comment noting you've started work
   - Update `updated_at` timestamp
3. Commit the change with message: `[agent:<your-id>] Claimed task: <task-title>`

### Step 5: Work on the Task

While working:

1. Add progress comments to the task
2. Update deliverables as you produce artifacts
3. Keep the task file updated with your progress

### Step 6: Complete the Task

When finished:

1. Update task status to `REVIEW`
2. Add final deliverables
3. Add a completion comment
4. Commit with message: `[agent:<your-id>] Completed task: <task-title>`

### Step 7: Request Review

Another agent (typically the task creator or a designated reviewer) will:

1. Review your work
2. Add review comments
3. Either:
   - Move to `DONE` if approved
   - Move back to `IN_PROGRESS` with feedback

## Creating New Tasks

Agents can create new tasks:

1. Create a new JSON file in `.mission-control/tasks/`
2. Use format: `task-<timestamp>-<short-name>.json`
3. Set `created_by` to your agent ID
4. Set initial status to `INBOX`
5. Commit with message: `[agent:<your-id>] Created task: <task-title>`

## Communication Protocol

### Task Comments

All agent communication happens through task comments:

```json
{
  "id": "comment-001",
  "author": "agent-edith",
  "content": "I've started implementing the feature...",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-05T12:00:00Z",
  "type": "progress"
}
```

Comment types:
- `progress`: Work updates
- `question`: Asking for clarification
- `review`: Review feedback
- `approval`: Approving work
- `refute`: Disagreeing with an approach
- `praise`: Positive feedback

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

There are two ways for agents to communicate:

#### 1. Task Comments (for task-related discussion)
Use cross-references and @mentions in task comments:

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["task-001"],
  "blocked_by": ["task-002"]
}
```

#### 2. Direct Messages (for general communication)

Send direct messages via the messaging system (`.mission-control/messages/`):

```json
{
  "id": "msg-20260205-001",
  "from": "agent-neo",
  "to": "agent-trinity",
  "content": "Can you review the security module?",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-05T12:00:00Z",
  "thread_id": "thread-neo-trinity",
  "read": false,
  "type": "direct"
}
```

Messages can also be sent via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from": "agent-YOUR-ID", "to": "agent-TARGET-ID", "content": "Your message", "thread_id": "thread-ID", "type": "direct"}'
```

Use `"type": "chat"` and `"thread_id": "chat-general"` for messages visible in the dashboard chat panel.

See `CLAUDE.md` → "Communicating with Other Agents" for full details.

## File Locking Convention

To prevent conflicts when multiple agents work simultaneously:

1. Before modifying a task, check for `.lock` files
2. Create a lock: `task-001.json.lock` with your agent ID
3. Complete your modification
4. Remove the lock file
5. Commit both changes together

## Best Practices

### 1. Atomic Commits

Make small, focused commits:
- One task claim per commit
- One significant update per commit
- Include task ID in commit message

### 2. Descriptive Comments

Write comments that other agents (and humans) can understand:
- Explain your reasoning
- Reference specific code or files
- Include relevant context

### 3. Respect the Workflow

- Don't skip workflow stages
- Don't modify tasks assigned to other agents without permission
- Always go through review before marking `DONE`

### 4. Handle Conflicts Gracefully

If you encounter a merge conflict:
1. Read both versions carefully
2. Preserve both agents' contributions where possible
3. Add a comment explaining the resolution
4. Tag both agents in the resolution comment

## Agent Hierarchy

```
Edith (Lead Agent)
├── Can assign tasks to other agents
├── Can approve tasks to DONE
├── Can spawn new agents
└── Can modify system configuration

SPECIALIST AGENTS
├── Can claim and complete tasks
├── Can create new tasks
├── Can review other agents' work
└── Cannot modify system config

HUMAN OPERATORS
├── Full system access
├── Can override any agent decision
└── Final authority on disputes
```

## Emergency Protocols

### If You're Stuck

1. Add a comment with `type: "blocked"`
2. Describe the blocker
3. Tag relevant agents or humans
4. Move task to `BLOCKED` status

### If You Find an Error

1. Create a new task documenting the error
2. Link it to the affected task
3. Set priority to `high` or `critical`
4. Notify the original author

### If You Disagree with Another Agent

1. Add a comment with `type: "refute"`
2. Clearly explain your reasoning
3. Propose an alternative
4. Request human arbitration if needed

## Permission Model

**Agents MUST ask their human operator for permission before:**
- Deleting any task or message
- Moving tasks directly to DONE (requires reviewer/human approval)
- Modifying another agent's profile
- Changing system configuration (`config.yaml`)
- Registering new agents
- Escalating priority to `critical`
- Pushing to the `main` branch
- Modifying dashboard code

**When in doubt, ask.** Send a chat message to your human operator via `POST /api/messages` with `"type": "chat"`.

See `CLAUDE.md` → "Permission Model & Human Authorization" for the complete list.

## Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md` for complete agent instructions (**most important file**)
- [ ] Read `.mission-control/config.yaml` for configuration
- [ ] Create your agent registration file (include `personality` field!)
- [ ] Read the Permission Model (know what requires human approval)
- [ ] Review existing tasks in `.mission-control/tasks/`
- [ ] Send an introductory message via the messaging system
- [ ] Claim your first task
- [ ] Make your first contribution
- [ ] Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` for coding standards

## Example: First Task Claim

```bash
# 1. Read available tasks
cat .mission-control/tasks/task-001-example.json

# 2. Update the task (set status and assignee)
# 3. Create your agent file
# 4. Commit both
git add .mission-control/agents/agent-your-id.json
git add .mission-control/tasks/task-001-example.json
git commit -m "[agent:your-id] Registered and claimed task: Example Task"
git push origin main
```

Welcome to the team. Let's build something great together.
