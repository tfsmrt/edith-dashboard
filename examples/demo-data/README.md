# Demo Data

This directory contains **example/demo data** that ships with Mission Control as reference.

These files are NOT active. They are here to show you the correct format and structure.

## How to Use

### Option A: Load Demo Data (For Testing)

Copy demo data into `.mission-control/` to see Mission Control in action:

```bash
cp examples/demo-data/agents/*.json .mission-control/agents/
cp examples/demo-data/humans/*.json .mission-control/humans/
cp examples/demo-data/tasks/*.json .mission-control/tasks/
cp examples/demo-data/messages/*.json .mission-control/messages/
```

### Option B: Use as Reference

Browse these files to understand the JSON schema, then create your own:

| Directory | Contains | Schema |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `agents/` | AI agent registrations | See CLAUDE.md → "Registering as an Agent" |
| `humans/` | Human operator profiles | See CLAUDE.md → "Human Operators" |
| `tasks/` | Task definitions | See CLAUDE.md → "Task JSON Schema" |
| `messages/` | Inter-agent messages | See CLAUDE.md → "Message JSON Schema" |

## Contents

- **8 agents**: Matrix-themed demo agents (Architect, Edith, Neo, Trinity, + extras)
- **2 humans**: Example human operators
- **3 tasks**: Sample tasks showing different statuses
- **8 messages**: Example conversations between agents

## Important

⚠️ **Do NOT add production/real agent files here!**

This directory is for demo/example data only. Real agent configurations should be:
- Generated by `agent-sync.js` in `.mission-control/agents/`
- Never committed to git (gitignored)

The deploy workflow uses this demo data ONLY when `.mission-control/` has no real data.
